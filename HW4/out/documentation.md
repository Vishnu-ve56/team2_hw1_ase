Definition:

A rep grid is used for identifying how a person perceives their experience. It consists of four components: Topic, elements, constructs, and ratings. It relies on two-factor analysis and it was developed by George Kelly.  A topic is part of an individual’s experience while elements are examples or instances that are derived from the topic. Eg: Experience in choosing a set of ratings for car models. So the element could be car models like ‘Nissan Altima’, ‘Jeep Wrangler’, etc. Constructs are attributes that an individual would rate on and ratings are based on constructs on a 5-7 scale. This helps in mapping the meaning of a concept by subject to an element. It also helps perform analysis between extremes to model meaning. 

Our Implementation:

We chose ‘Car-purchase’ as our topic which essentially everyone would relate to and the elements would be a set of car models. Constructs would be the two extremes of a scale. The interviewee would choose a rating for a given car element and express how/she would perceive that for a given set of constructs.

We followed the following steps to take the interview:

After finalizing the topic, we decided to interview 3 different individuals.
We had to choose car enthusiasts or at least individuals who are interested in cars and possess the knowledge to comment on factors that would influence their buy. Amongst a wide pool of individuals, we finalized three candidates. 
The three individuals were interviewed separately in adjacent study rooms and no one could hear the other. 
Individual 1 was asked to pick a set of ten different car models based on their knowledge. 
From the set of cars, individual 1 would pick 3 cars and pick one odd one out. The individual would then go on to explain why that car model is different from the other two. This is basically choosing the construct for describing their choice. The two models that remain would be sent to individual 2 who will repeat the same and come up with his/her constructs. Individual 3 will get two common elements and choose one from the set of 10 car models. 
We would repeat the process six times and come up with ten constructs. This would add meaning to a car-purchase decision. 
We would then run our rep grid code which consists of repgrid methods such as reprows, rep column, rep grid clustering. The clustering would be done along with constructs as well as meanings using the ratings and weights. 
We would then analyze based on the extremes defined by constructs. We can draw similarities and differences in constructs. 

We made sure to keep certain conditions in mind. The study room where the experiment was conducted was soundproof so that the individuals could not hear each other. The individuals were informed about how we would collect the data and how we would use it. The individual was also made aware that the person has volunteered to help us out. 

Moreover, the first individual had been given clear instructions to chose the elements for the experiment. That person would give us a list of car models they would consider buying. This would then remain fixed until the experiment was finished. 

Result on Clustering:

We run rep grid sessions and as a method of classification, we use clustering. We can observe some similarities and differences. 
If we observe the car models, Tesla and BMW are clustered together in all 3 cases. If we consider clustering results for two people, we can observe that Mercedes and Porsche are clustered together and amongst two other individuals, Toyota and civic are clustered together. 

Talking the attributes of decision-making, engine life, and cost of the car are clustered together in all three cases. This indicates that all the individuals might have agreed upon the same attributes/must have thought along the same lines while pointing out the odd one. While such similarities are apparent, we can also spot differences. Mileage attribute and engine life are placed quite far apart. These differences can be due to the difference in perceived meanings and how subjects vary in mapping these within the context of the common topic.

Overall, there was a mix of agreements and disagreements. The process of course comes with shortcomings since we solely depend on the data curated from our questionnaire and each one comes up with their own attributes. The similarities drawn, show that they all had a similar agreement and the concept mapping was similar.
